# Visual-Object-Recognition( Prediction of Visual Perception from BOLD fMRI )

# Dataset description
The dataset used in this Report was obtained from the Open fMRI database (accession number ds000105). Based on the same dataset, there have been 3 major publications. Haxby , the original investigator of the dataset, postulated that patterns of response found in the Ventral Temporal (VT) lobe directly corresponded to the object being perceived.

From the data collected by Haxby , each BOLD file is an array of 3D fMRI images with a shape voxels. Each such image is taken periodically every 2.5 seconds as the subject is made to look at different objects. In every run, the subjectâ€™s brain is scanned for 300 seconds, thus contributing to 121 samples (300 / 2.5). Each of the 4 subjects were made to undergo 12 such runs.

This dataset was obtained from the OpenfMRI project (http://www.openfmri.org).
